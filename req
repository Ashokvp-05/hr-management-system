Here are **clear, professional instruction points** explaining **how to use and manage the Payslip system with full security**, based on the security architecture.

You can use these for **project documentation, interview, or system design**.

# ✅ Secure Payslip System – Usage & Security Instructions

---

## 1. User Login & Identity Verification

* All users must log in using Employee ID/Email and password.
* Passwords must be encrypted in the database.
* Enable Two-Factor Authentication (OTP/SMS/Email).
* Do not allow access without successful verification.

---

## 2. Token-Based Authentication

* After login, system generates a secure JWT token.
* Token is required for every request.
* Set token expiry time.
* Automatically log out after expiry.

---

## 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

* Assign roles: Admin, Manager, Employee.
* Define permissions for each role.
* Employee: View only own payslip.
* Admin: View and manage all payslips.
* Block unauthorized role access.

---

## 4. Secure API Access

* All payslip APIs must be protected.
* Verify token and role before processing request.
* Reject requests without valid authorization.
* Prevent direct access to backend services.

---

## 5. User-Level Authorization

* Match logged-in user ID with payslip user ID.
* Do not allow users to access others’ records.
* Validate ownership before showing data.

---

## 6. Secure Database Management

* Store salary data in encrypted format.
* Restrict database access using limited privileges.
* Do not allow public database connections.
* Backup database regularly.

---

## 7. Protected File Storage (PDF Payslips)

* Store payslip PDFs in private folders.
* Do not expose files via public URLs.
* Allow access only through secured API.
* Verify user before downloading file.

---

## 8. Authorization Middleware

* Implement middleware for all payroll routes.
* Check login status and role.
* Deny unauthorized requests immediately.
* Log rejected access attempts.

---

## 9. Audit Logging System

* Record all important actions:

  * Login
  * Payslip upload
  * Download
  * Edit/Delete
* Store user ID, time, and IP address.
* Use logs for monitoring and investigation.

---

## 10. Security Monitoring & Alerts

* Monitor failed login attempts.
* Detect suspicious activities.
* Send alerts to admin.
* Block users after multiple failures.

---

## 11. Data Transmission Security

* Use HTTPS for all communications.
* Encrypt data during transfer.
* Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

---

## 12. Input Validation & Attack Prevention

* Validate all form inputs.
* Prevent SQL Injection and XSS.
* Sanitize file uploads.
* Allow only approved formats.

---

## 13. Session Management

* Auto logout inactive users.
* Prevent session hijacking.
* Restrict multiple logins if required.

---

## 14. Backup & Recovery System

* Schedule daily backups.
* Store backups securely.
* Test data recovery process.
* Protect backup files.

---

## 15. Compliance & Privacy

* Follow company data policies.
* Protect personal and financial data.
* Allow access only for business use.
* Maintain confidentiality.

---

## 16. Secure Payslip Usage Flow

1. User logs in securely.
2. System verifies identity with OTP.
3. JWT token is generated.
4. User requests payslip.
5. Middleware checks role and ID.
6. System validates ownership.
7. Encrypted data is fetched.
8. Secure PDF is served.
9. Activity is logged.
10. System monitors access.

---

# 📌 Short Summary (Easy Version)

* Secure login with OTP.
* Token-based authentication.
* Role-based access.
* Encrypted salary data.
* Protected PDF files.
* Strict API security.
* Continuous monitoring.
